# Requirements Specification

The  Requirements  gathering  is  a  very  important  stage of the software engineering life cycle due to the fact that the engineers that are workingas part of a team, usually most of the time in a SCRUM team which is a  methodology  of  Agile  development  need  to  know  the  different  typesof features the software will  have  as  well  as  any  constraints  that  willhinder the performance of the system.  

There are two specific types of requirements and they are:

User Requirements:   Statements  in  natural  language  that  aretypically written for customers.
System Requirements:  Structured sentences that highlights thesystemâ€™s functionality.
